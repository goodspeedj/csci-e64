        The following map of Europe shows differing population densities with the most populous
        countries a darker shade and the least populous countries a lighter shade.  The most 
        populous country is Russia (143,369,806), which has a small corner of land in Europe.  
        The least populous country is Iceland (321,857).

        The map employs a mouse over effect that will highlight the border of the country by making
        the stroke color darker and thicker.  The tool tip will also display the country name as well
        as the population of that country.  Countries that are not part of Europe were colored a light
        shade of gray so that they faded into the background and the European countries popped out to 
        the user.
